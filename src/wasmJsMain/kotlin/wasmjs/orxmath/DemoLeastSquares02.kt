/**
 * Demonstrate how to use the `least squares` method to fit a cubic bezier to noisy points.
 *
 * On every animation frame, 10 concentric circles are created centered on the window and converted to contours.
 * In OPENRNDR, circular contours are made ouf of 4 cubic-Bezier curves. Each of those curves is considered
 * one by one as the ground truth, then 5 points are sampled near those curves.
 * Finally, two matrices are constructed using those points and math operations are applied to
 * revert the randomization attempting to reconstruct the original curves.
 *
 * The result is drawn on every animation frame, revealing concentric circles that are more or less similar
 * to the ground truth depending on the random values used.
